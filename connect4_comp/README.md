## Competition Recap

This competition was a fun opportunity to create adversarial search agents and put them to use against real opponents.
Before competing, I created various types of agents to determine which was optimal to compete with.
Agents created included heuristic alpha-beta tree search and modified versions of pure monte carlo search and restricted monte carlo tree search.

In the competition, I used the heuristic alpha-beta tree search agent to win the first round. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a second round opponent due to low class participation, so I was not able to continue the competition.

## Final Thoughts

Although I made a competitive heuristic alpha-beta tree search agent, I believe there were possible improvements to become a more challenging opponent.
The heuristic function was too complex and took a long time to run; making a simpler and faster heuristic function could be more effective.
A monte carlo search agent would be effective for the competition if an efficient playout and selection policy were implemented.
