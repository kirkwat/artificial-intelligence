## [Assignment 2](https://github.com/kirkwat/artificial-intelligence/blob/main/assignment_2/Assignment_2.ipynb)

Compared the performance of a simple reflex agent and a model-based reflex agent for a vacuum cleaner robot.

## [Assignment 3](https://github.com/kirkwat/artificial-intelligence/blob/main/assignment_3/Assignment_3.ipynb)

Compared the performance of breadth-first search, depth-first search, iterative-deepening search, greedy best-first search and A* search when solving a maze. 

## [Assignment 4](https://github.com/kirkwat/artificial-intelligence/blob/main/assignment_4/n_queens.ipynb)

Compared the performance of steepest-ascent hill climbing search and stochastic hill climbing search when solving the n-queens problem. 

## [Assignment 5](https://github.com/kirkwat/artificial-intelligence/blob/main/assignment_5/assignment_connect4.ipynb)

Compared the performance of minimax search with alpha-beta pruning, heuristic alpha-beta tree search, and pure monte carlo search when playing Connect 4.

## [Connect 4 Competition](https://github.com/kirkwat/artificial-intelligence/tree/main/connect4_comp)

Created a heuristic alpha-beta tree search agent to complete in a class Connect 4 competition.
